# A/B Testing

## Definition:
### AB testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing. In AB testing, we create and compare two or more variants of a specific element or process in order to find which variant perform better in terms of a XYZ goal then eventually keeping the better performing variant.

## Overview of the AB testing process
### 1. Define the objective
#### Clearly define the goal or hypothesis you want to test.
### 2. Create variants
#### Develop different versions of the element or feature you want to test.
### 3. Split the audience
#### Randomly divide your target audience into separate groups. Each group is exposed to one specific variant. It is important to ensure the groups are statistically significant and representative of the target population.
### 4. Run the experiment
#### Implement the variants and collect relevant data on user interactions and behaviors.
### 5. Analyze the results
#### Perform statistical analysis on the collected data to determine if there are significant differences between the variants. Commonly used techniques include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-values.
### 6. Draw conclusions
#### Based on the analysis, determine which variant performs better in achieving the desired objective. It is essential to consider statistical significance, practical significance, and potential confounding factors during interpretation.
### 7. Implement the winning variant
#### If a significant difference is observed, choose the better-performing variant and implement it in the live environment.
